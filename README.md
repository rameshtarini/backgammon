# Backgammon

Grab a friend and play a full game of backgammon! 

You and another player will take turns rolling dice. After, you will choose which piece you want to move and how far you want to move it depending on your dice roll. Following the rules of backgammon, the pieces will go to the calculated places and eventually end on the bar. 

In the end, whichever player has all their pieces on the bar first wins eternal bragging rights. Enjoy!

This game was coded leveraging Object-Oriented Programming and the header file window.h in order to utilize the gotoxy function.
